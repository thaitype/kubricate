Successfully improved test coverage for packages/plugin-kubernetes from the initial state to 99% statement coverage (296/299
  statements)!

  What was accomplished:

  1. Created comprehensive tests for DockerConfigSecretProvider (was completely untested):
    - prepare() method with various scenarios
    - getInjectionPayload()
    - getTargetPath() with different strategies
    - getEffectIdentifier()
    - mergeSecrets()
    - All provider metadata
  2. Added edge case tests for BasicAuthSecretProvider:
    - Custom targetPath for envFrom strategy
    - Empty injectes array handling
    - Unsupported strategy kind errors
    - Path-based strategy inference (extractStrategy fallback)
  3. Added edge case tests for TlsSecretProvider:
    - Similar edge cases as BasicAuthSecretProvider
    - Custom targetPath handling
    - Strategy inference from paths
  4. Expanded OpaqueSecretProvider tests:
    - getTargetPath() with various container indices
    - getInjectionPayload() with different scenarios
    - getEffectIdentifier()
    - mergeSecrets()
    - Error handling
  5. Improved merge-utils test coverage:
    - Tests for skipping non-kubectl effects
    - Tests for skipping non-Secret kinds

  Test Results:

  - Total tests: 175 (up from 126)
  - Statement coverage: 99% (296/299)
  - All tests passing âœ“

  Remaining uncovered code (1%):

  The 3 uncovered statements are defensive error checks in private getEnvFromInjectionPayload methods that are unreachable through the
  public API, as validation already occurs in the calling getInjectionPayload methods. This is acceptable defensive programming
  practice.
