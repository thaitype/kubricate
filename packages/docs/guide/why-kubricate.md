# Why Kubricate

**Why is managing Kubernetes infrastructure still so tedious and error-prone?**
You end up repeating YAML across environments, scattering secrets in different places, and shipping configs with no validation or type checking.

> It’s hard to reuse. Hard to trace. Easy to break.

Kubricate replaces that chaos with reusable, type-safe infrastructure — written in TypeScript and validated at build time.
> No more copy-paste templates. No custom annotations. No runtime surprises.

Imagine managing your entire Kubernetes platform without hand-writing a single line of YAML.
With Kubricate, you declare infrastructure and secrets once — and generate everything from code you trust.
Your single source of truth — across teams, environments, and pipelines.
