# Agent Context Directory

This directory is used to store context information for the agent. It may include configuration files, logs, or other data that the agent needs to operate effectively.

Consider to keep this directory lightweight and organized to ensure optimal performance of the agent.

## Rules

- Do not store working plan or progress files here.
- Allow working files only development purposes and ensure they are cleaned up regularly.
