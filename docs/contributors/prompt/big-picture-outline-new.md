Love it. Given your draft, here’s a **clean split into 4 pages max** that stays big-picture, avoids redundancy, and gives readers a sensible path.

---

# 1) **Architecture Overview**

**Goal:** Explain Kubricate at 10,000 ft — why it exists, how it’s layered, and the end-to-end flow.
**Audience:** Evaluators, new contributors, platform leads.

**Suggested filename:** `01-architecture-overview.md`
**Keep it to:** ~900–1200 words, 2 diagrams.

**Sections**

1. What Kubricate Is (Problem → Solution → Outcomes)
2. System Architecture Map (layers + one-line responsibilities)
3. End-to-End Flow (Configure → Validate → Prepare → Merge → Render/Apply)
4. Effects-First Design (why data-before-side-effects)
5. Where to Next (links to pages 2–4)

**Diagrams**

* Layered Architecture (big blocks)
* Lifecycle Timeline (steps vs actors)

**Exclude:** CLI command details, plugin APIs, repo tree (link to other pages).

---

# 2) **User Workflows & CLI Lifecycle**

**Goal:** Show what users actually run and in what order; map commands to the lifecycle.
**Audience:** Practitioners, CI/CD owners.

**Suggested filename:** `02-user-workflows-cli.md`
**Keep it to:** ~800–1000 words, 1 matrix, 1 mini diagram.

**Sections**

1. How the Lifecycle Maps to Commands (1:1 map, brief)
2. Local Dev Recipe

   * `generate` → `secret validate` → `secret apply` → `kubectl apply`
   * Why this order
3. CI/CD Recipe

   * Fail fast on `secret validate`, artifact with `generate`, apply secrets only in deploy
4. GitOps Recipe

   * Validate+generate in CI; commit manifests; secrets via job/operator
5. Decision Matrix (Goal → Command → Where)
6. Troubleshooting Quick Wins (top 5 misorders and fixes)

**Diagram**

* Tiny swimlane: User/CI → CLI → Orchestrator → Outputs

**Exclude:** Deep secret/provider theory or plugin contracts.

---

# 3) **Secrets System — Conceptual Overview**

**Goal:** High-level mental model of connectors, providers, managers, orchestrator, conflicts — without API detail.
**Audience:** Engineers deciding how to model secrets; reviewers.

**Suggested filename:** `03-secrets-overview.md`
**Keep it to:** ~900–1200 words, 2 diagrams, 1 tiny code snippet (≤5 lines).

**Sections**

1. Why “Connector × Provider” (separation of source vs format)
2. Roles

   * Connectors (read-only sources)
   * Providers (K8s-aware formatting & injection)
   * SecretManager (registry)
   * SecretsOrchestrator (validate/prepare/merge)
3. Effects Model (prepare returns data; apply later)
4. Conflict Levels & Default Strategies (intraProvider auto-merge; cross* = error)
5. Validation Layers (config → connector → provider)
6. Patterns & Anti-patterns (short list)

**Diagrams**

* Connector × Provider Matrix (conceptual)
* Conflict/Merge Flow (simple diamond chart)

**Exclude:** Full APIs, unit-test suites, verbose examples (link to “Extensibility” and examples).

---

# 4) **Extensibility & Monorepo Map**

**Goal:** Show how to extend Kubricate safely and where code lives; set versioning expectations.
**Audience:** Contributors & integrators building plugins or templates.

**Suggested filename:** `04-extensibility-and-monorepo.md`
**Keep it to:** ~900–1200 words, 1 repo tree, 1 table.

**Sections**

1. Extension Points (what you can add)

   * Connectors (new sources)
   * Providers (new formats/injection)
   * Stack Templates (reusable compositions)
2. Design Principles (open/closed; effects-first; single responsibility)
3. Monorepo at 10,000 ft (short tree + roles)
4. Versioning Model

   * Fixed: `kubricate`, `@kubricate/core`, `@kubricate/stacks`
   * Independent: `plugin-*`, `toolkit`, `kubernetes-models`
5. Contribution Boundaries

   * “Who talks to whom” (no cross-layer imports)
   * Testing expectations (unit vs integration, no live backends)
6. Pointers to Reference Docs & Examples

**Artifacts**

* Repo tree (top-level only)
* Package responsibility table

**Exclude:** Step-by-step “how to write a plugin” — link to reference/tutorial pages.

---

## Cross-links (put at the end of each page)

* **From 1 → 2:** “Ready to actually run it? See User Workflows.”
* **From 1 → 3:** “Curious how secrets are modeled? See Secrets Overview.”
* **From 1 → 4:** “Want to extend Kubricate? See Extensibility & Monorepo.”
* **From 2 → 3:** “Deep dive on the secrets lifecycle.”
* **From 3 → 4:** “Implementing your own connector/provider? Start here.”
* **From 4 → Examples:** link to `examples/` folders.

---

## Keep scope tight (editorial guardrails)

* **One diagram per major section** (no more than 5 total across all pages).
* **Minimal code** on pages 1–3 (≤5-line illustrative snippets).
* **No API signatures**; link to reference docs.
* **≤1200 words/page** to keep scanning-friendly.

If you want, I can scaffold these four files with headings and TODO blocks so you can drop them straight into the repo.
